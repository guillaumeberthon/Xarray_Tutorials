Contributing
------------

This repository is a great opportunity to start contributing to Xarray.
Please note that examples submitted to this repository should follow these
guidelines:

1.  Run top-to-bottom without intervention from the user
2.  Not require external data sources that may disappear over time
    (external data sources that are highly unlikely to disappear are fine)
3.  Not be resource intensive, and should run within 2GB of memory
4.  Be clear and contain enough prose to explain the topic at hand
5.  Be concise and limited to one or two topics, such that a reader can
    get through the example within a few minutes of reading
6.  Be of general relevance to Xarray users, and so not too specific on a
    particular problem or use case.
